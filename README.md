## **Sales Analysis (Python & Pandas)**  
- **Business Problem:** A company needs their sales data analysed to to uncover trends, patterns, and key insights.
- **How I plan to solve the problem**: I plan to use python to analyse their sales data by identifying the best-selling products, seasonal trends, and more.
- I will need to:
  - Import sales data
  - Ensure data is clean before analysis
  - Clear Documentation: The python notebook will have comments describing functionality and purpose for readability
 
## Explanation of python code used to solve the problem
**Setup**
1) First I needed to import the data. The dataset consists of multiple csv files that contain data for different months of the year.
  - For analysis these files needed to be consolidated into one file.
  - To do this I wrote code to list all the files in the folder containing csv files
  - Appended the contents of each csv file one by one into a empty list (Lists can store dataframes).
  - Combine the data so all rows from each CSV file are merged into one DataFrame, instead of being stored separately in a list.
